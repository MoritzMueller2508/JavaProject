# JavaProjectWork

This is my JavaProjectWork for university. 
This project will be my evaluation in the programmingInJava lecture.
In order to pass this semester, I need 56% in Java, to get 100% in C and Java combined.

So... Let's do this


You can start the project with your command prompt.
To do so, just type navigate to the folder JavaHausarbeit\out\artifacts and start the JavaHausarbeit.jar in the commandPromt or powerShell.
You will then be asked, on which point you want to start, and what your destination should be. You can choose out of existing cities.


ToDO: Write methode to add cities and paths.
